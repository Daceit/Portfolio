                    <p>My name is Matthew I grew up in Clovis, California. Since I was a child, I've wanted to do
                        something in computer science.</p>

                    <p>The CART (Center for Advanced Research and Technology) showcase was an event at CART where groups
                        were tasked with showing off what they have been learning at CART. My group made a website based
                        on the world of Jurassic Park and showing it off at showcase. In order to accomplish this I
                        learned the basics of HTML and CSS as well as other skills such as teamwork, professionalism,
                        and presentation skills.</p>

                    <p>During my time at CART (Center for Advanced Research and Technology) I was part of the Overwatch
                        Esports club where we practiced and competed in local school tournaments. During my time in
                        club, I learned valuable lessons in teamwork and collaboration.</p>
